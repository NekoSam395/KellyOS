This is Kelly, our mascot in this mod.

## Hey Sam, why did you put this mod to GitHub?
Nice question, there's 3 reason why I repo this mod:
1. Mods are open-sourced and I think KellyOS's forks will be great.
2. Most of mods in GitHub is for Minecraft, but no one (except this one) PB95 mods in GitHub so I decided put my mod in this website.
3. I don't have [Progressbar95 Steam version](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304550/Progressbar95/).
